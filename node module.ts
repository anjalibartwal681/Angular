you can think of a Node module as a collection of functionality bundled together for a specific purpose. 
A Node module often encapsulates related functions, objects, or classes within a single file, making it a convenient and modular unit of code. 
These modules can be seen as libraries in the sense that they provide reusable code that can be easily integrated into other projects.
