The @Component decorator in the TypeScript file provides metadata to Angular, indicating how the component should be used and how its template and styles are linked.

Angular app - one or  more module
  components - html + class
  
  module -one  or more components  and services
services - business logic
 a components made of three part

1)template  which represent html view which will be the user interface for  the application

2) class   code  that support view data   methodes  which can contorl the logice of view
3)metadata =  >   infomation  a decorator

1)Template (HTML View): This represents the user interface for the application. It defines the structure and layout of the component.

html

<!-- Example Component Template -->
<div>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ content }}</p>
    <!-- Other HTML elements and content -->
</div>






  </div>
  (2 ) Class (Code that Supports View): This is the TypeScript code that supports the view.
  It includes properties and methods that control the logic of the view. This class is often referred to as the component class.

typescript

// Example Component Class
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-my-component',
    templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css']
})
export class MyComponent {
    title: string = 'Hello, World!';
    content: string = 'This is a sample component.';
    // Other properties and methods
}

3)Metadata (Decorator): The metadata is additional information about the component that Angular needs to know. It is provided using a decorator, which is the @Component decorator in this case. The decorator specifies the selector, templateUrl (HTML file path), styleUrls (CSS file paths), and other metadata for the component.

In the above example, the @Component decorator is used to provide metadata about the component, such as the selector, template, and styles.

So, in summary, an Angular component is a combination of the template (HTML view), the class (supporting TypeScript code), and metadata (provided by the decorator). This modular structure allows for the development of maintainable and reusable components in Angular applications.
